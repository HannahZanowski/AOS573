    "The data we'll be using for this homework is a sounding from Springfield, Missouri on May 22, 2011, the day of the devastating Joplin, MO tornado. Twice a day at locations across the U.S., the National Weather Service (NWS) launches [radiosondes](https://www.weather.gov/upperair/factsheet) (on weather balloons) that measure various atmospheric properties including pressure, temperature, humidity, windspeed and direction, etc. The information collected from the radiosonde is known as an upper air sounding. You can get past sounding data from stations all over North America from this [sounding database](http://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/sounding.html) from the University of Wyoming. You can also get present [sounding data](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/exper/soundings/) (and much more) from the [NWS Storm Prediction Center](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/). "
