    "In this notebook you'll be using some output from the [Tropical Rainfall measuring Mission](https://gpm.nasa.gov/missions/trmm) (TRMM). To keep the regridding from getting out of hand I've provided you with a single 2D precipitation field from 31 July 2016. Read in the data in the file `trmm.2016-07-31T12.nc` and take a look at the contents. Go through the typical questions to help you become familiar with your data: What variables exist in the dataset? What are the units? What are the latitude and longitude ranges? What is the resolution? There's no need to write these down as answers in the notebook, but make sure you have a sense of what you're working with before you proceed."

In addition to the latitudes and longitudes, this target grid must have latitude and longitude bounds (so you can do conservative regridding). You will need to create these bounds yourself. The bounds should be halfway between each grid point, and each 1D list of latitude and longitude bounds should be 1 point larger than the number of latitudes and longitudes, respectively. If you get stuck, look at how lat_b and lon_b are structured relative to lat and lon in the data; this should help."
