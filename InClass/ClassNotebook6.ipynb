We'll be using forecast data from the [HRRR](https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/hrrr/) (High Resolution Rapid Refresh), a high resolution (3 km) forecast model that assimilates radar data and creates hourly forecasts for the U.S. You can download HRRR data from a number of places including [NCEP](https://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/products/hrrr/) and [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-hrrr-pds/).\n",

    "1. Save your notebook and make sure your results are visible (cells have been executed)\n",
    "2. Open a terminal and navigate to your local `AOS573` repository\n",
    "3. If you haven't done so, move your completed in-class notebook into your InClass directory (if you opened and worked on the notebook from this directory you don't need to do anything).\n",
