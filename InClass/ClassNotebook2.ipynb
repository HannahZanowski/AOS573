    "## Welcome to your second in-class jupyter notebook activity!\n",
    "In this notebook you'll get more practice with scipy. Specifically, you'll be working with the 800,000 year CO$_{2}$ record from the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA) Dome C ice cores. EPICA ran from 1995-2004 with the goal of extending the 400,000 year Vostok ice core record by reaching even deeper (>3km! Deeper ice=older ice in general) ice in the Antarctic ice sheet. You can find a link to the original paper here: [Eight Glacial Cycles from an Antarctic Ice Core](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02599). However, we'll be working with some slightly updated data, and you can find that publication here: [Bereiter et al., 2015](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014GL061957/abstract). \n",
