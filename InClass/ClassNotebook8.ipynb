We'll be using forecast data from the [GFS](https://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/emc/pages/numerical_forecast_systems/gfs.php) (Global Forecast System), a forecast model developed by the [National Centers for Environmental Prediction](https://www.weather.gov/ncep/). You can access output from the GFS at [NCEP](https://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/products/gfs/) and [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-gfs-bdp-pds/).\n",
