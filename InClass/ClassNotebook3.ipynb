We'll be using data from the [Survey of Earned Doctorates](https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvydoctorates/), an annual survey sponsored by the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Education, and National Endowment for the Humanities. The SED collects information on how many doctorates were earned in a given year, the field in which they were earned, and demographic information on the recipients. We will also be using demographic data from the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/).\n",
