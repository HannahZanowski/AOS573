### Example Final Project

In this folder, you'll find an example of what a really good final project looks like.
This project was done by a former student in the department, Harrison Tran, who haS
graciously given permission to me to share this with all of you.

I have included only his analysis notebook in this folder, but if you would like to see how
he organized his entire gitlab repository, you can find it here:
