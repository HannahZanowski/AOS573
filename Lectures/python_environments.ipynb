    "# What is a python environment?\n",
    "An environment is a self-contained set of python <b>modules</b> and <b>packages</b> that you can use to do your work. You can think of an environment like you do any other real-world environment, like your home or your office. In your home environment, you typically have a set of things that makes that environment home for you--your personal belongings, your family, etc. The same goes for your office--here maybe you have your workstation and other things for research like your textbooks, etc. Python environments more or less work the same way, except that instead of belongings and people, the various 'things' that make up a specific environment are the particular tools (in this case packages) that you want to use in that environment. Just like you move between home and work, you can switch between python environments as well!"

You can make one of these yourself by opening a text editor, adding in your packages, and saving it with the `.yml` extension. Open the `aos573_f23.yml` file in the ```Environments/``` directory in our course material repo to see what one of these looks like.\n",
