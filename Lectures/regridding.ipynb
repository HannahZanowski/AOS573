    "## 1. What is regridding?\n",
    "Regridding is really just multi-dimensional interpolation, and as the word suggests, it is useful when you want to take data that sit on one grid and transform them to another. You can upscale a grid (i.e., go from a higher resolution to a lower resolution) or you can downscale (go from lower resolution to higher resolution) depending on your needs. Keep in mind that the latter adds no new information! The NCAR climate data guide has a [nice overview](https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/climate-data-tools-and-analysis/regridding-overview) if you want to learn more."

    "### Types of grids\n",
    "There are several types of grids that we typically come across when working with geospatial data, and many of you are probably familiar with the first two although you may not realize it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <b>Rectilinear</b>--a rectilinear grid is a grid in which each cell is a rectangle. Each rectangle need not be the same size. (A special case of a rectilinear grid is a regular grid. Each grid cell is the same size on a regular grid, and the grid itself can be described with 1D lists of equally-spaced latitudes and equally-spaced longitudes.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <b>Curvilinear</b>--a curvilinear grid is a grid made up of non-rectangular quadrilaterals (e.g., the lines on a globe are a curvilinear grid, hence why spherical coordinates are a curvilinear coordinate system; it just means the coordinate lines can be curved!)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. <b>Unstructured</b>--some common forms of this are a \"grid\" made up of a tessellation of equilateral triangles or hexagons, like in [MPAS](https://ncar.ucar.edu/what-we-offer/models/model-prediction-across-scales-mpas)"

    "\n",
    "1. <b>Nearest neighbors</b>--uses points closest to the grid point to do the regridding; can introduce new extrema<br>\n",
    "   -Nearest source to destination: destination point mapped to closest source point (given a destination, what's the nearest source?); some source points can be excluded, a single source point can be mapped to multiple destinations! <br>\n",
    "   -Nearest destination to source: source points mapped to closest destination point (given a source, what's the nearest destination?); some destinations will be excluded, and multiple sources can be mapped to the same destination (these are added together)!\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. <b>Bilinear</b>--linear interpolation in multiple dimensions; good for smoothly varying fields, not great for discontinuous fields\n",
    "\n",
    "3. <b>Conservative</b>--conserves the integral of the source field during regridding; better for upscaling and computing fluxes\n",
    "\n",
    "4. <b>Patch</b>--least squares fit of surrounding surface patches; good for when you need accurate derivatives; slower to implement\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>A few rules of thumb:</b><br>\n",
    "-In general, compute nonlinear quantities on the original grid before doing regridding operations<br>\n",
    "-Compute fluxes on the original grid if you can as well, especially if you're computing budgets--it's really hard to get budgets to close if you regrid without thinking about the methodology you're using"
