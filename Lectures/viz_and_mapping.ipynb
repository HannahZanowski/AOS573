    "Not all map projections are created equal, and many of them _severely distort_ the sizes of the continents as a result. As it turns out, it's not particularly easy to take a 3D surface and flatten it to make it 2D without distorting some areas. This is always the struggle that we have when presenting geospatial data, but there are some map projections that can handle these issues better than others, depending on the coordinate system that they use. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the Mollweide and Equal Earth projections above are _equal area_ which means that area is preserved when creating the 2D map. These tend to show areas in the tropics particularly well, and they should, as the tropics cover a considerable amount of area on our planet! They don't show the polar regions well, but we can use other projections, like a polar stereographic projection, to present data in these regions instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "The PlateCarree projection is the typical projection that geospatial data sits on--it's the equirectangular lat/lon grid that you're already familiar with. However, because it is equirectangular, it is NOT area-preserving, and you can see this by the large distortion at the poles (Antarctica is big, but it's not _that_ big).\n",
    "\n",
    "><b><font color='red'>Note:</font> In general, when presenting data on a global map, it is a good idea to avoid projections that severely distort certain regions, as it makes us think that these areas are larger than they are and as a result have an outsized influence on things when they don't!</b>\n",

This is sort of an art form, and different people will tell you different things about what matters and what doesn't. In most cases, the default python figure font works fine, but keep in mind that journals will often require you to use a specific subset of fonts for figures, etc. There are also some fonts that are more friendly to those with dyslexia, so it's good to know some decent ones that you can use. \n",
