If you don't like having to enter your personal access token every time you push to your remote respository, there are some steps you can take to remedy this, particularly by setting up [SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh). <b>Note:</b> This is a somewhat involved process, and one that I have tried to set up unsuccessfully for myself on the AOS Jupyterhub, but I had no problem getting it set up on my mac, so if you want to set it up on your personal computer for your future work outside of this class I am happy to chat about it."
