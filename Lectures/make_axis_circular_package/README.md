## make_ax_circular

This is a package that takes a cartopy geoaxes 
instance and makes it circular instead of rectangular.
It is particularly useful for plotting circular North
and South polar stereographic projections. As designed, 
it only works on cartopy geoaxes instances.

If this package were actually on the python package 
index or intended to be distributed for others to use
you'd probably also want to provide installation
instructions, etc.
